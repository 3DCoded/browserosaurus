Browserosaurus is now considered _Public Feature Complete_.

I started this project to solve a simple problem: open the browser of my choice
when I click a link. Over the last three and a half years, I have added several
community-requested features and support for many browsers that I do not use.
Browserosaurus has achieved what it set out to do, and is my favourite hobby,
and whilst I am grateful for the public buzz that Browserosaurus has garnered
over the years, I feel I must now draw a line in the sand with regards to
community requests to support new features. I hope that you will respect this
decision and the many hours of development that have already gone into this
freely available app. This does not mean the project is dead! I will continue to
support Browserosaurus, and any features I feel I need from it, for as long as I
use it. I will also continue to release these updates publicly as long as the
donations cover the cost of the yearly Apple Developer account that is required
to notarize the app so that it can work on your machine.

A big thank-you to all that have been involved in helping make Browserosaurus
through PRs and bug spotting, and to all the projects that it relies upon.

If you were going to request a new feature or ask for support of a new browser,
you are probably disappointed to read the notice above. Please fork the project,
that is what Open Source is all about. Make something for your own personality,
strip out the stuff you donâ€™t like, have fun with your own brand (I once
suggested the name Browseratops to someone who wanted to make a Linux portâ€¦ they
didnâ€™t, by the way, in case you fancied trying that too). Be sure to tell me how
you get on; I'm always interested to hear about new projects.
